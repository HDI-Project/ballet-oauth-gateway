# github-oauth-gateway

Gateway for authenticating with GitHub using OAuth.

Primarily used by
[Assembl√©](https://github.com/HDI-Project/ballet-assemble)
to authenticate Jupyter Lab sessions with GitHub.

There is a free and public deployment at https://github-oauth-gateway.herokuapp.com or you
can deploy your own instance.

## Usage

1. get this gateway app's client ID
2. initiate the OAuth login flow with GitHub, providing the client ID from
   step 1 as well as a secret key of your choice. After successful
   authorization, GitHub will send a secret code to the gateway.
3. request an access token from the gateway; it will exchange the secret code
   for an access token with GitHub, send you the access token, and delete any
   record of your request.
   
## Deployment

There is a reference deployment at https://github-oauth-gateway.herokuapp.com/
